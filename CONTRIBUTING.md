**The branch name depends of the type of your branch**. You can see the types below:**

## Branch Types:
* Sample: used to implement new samples. Can be started from an issue and **and you need a readme.md containing the image of the prototype so that the idealized design can be compared with the implemented design**. Started at the source of the problem (commit) from the source version. The prefix is `sample-`;
* Feature: used to implement new features. Can be started from an issue. Started at the source of the problem (commit) from the source version. The prefix is `feature-`;
* Fix: used to fix bugs and code smells. Can be started from an issue. Started at the source of the problem (commit) from the source version. Fix takes precedence over the feature and should be resolved quickly and has the same process. The prefix is: `fix-`;
